### example_fail
This is an example of the classic case where static registration fails when your tests are placed inside a static library.
See https://github.com/philsquared/Catch/issues/421

If you run the tests, you will see the following output (OUCH...)
```
==============================================================================
No tests ran
```

### example_register
`example_register/` is an example of a complete project with a library that will be tested.

Build it by calling `build.sh`
This will create a folder named `build`. You can run the test with either `ctest` or `make test` inside this folder.


### example_register_processed
`example_register_processed/` is a copy of `example_register/`, in which the cpp source code was modified after cmake was executed.

You can see the auto-generated functions `catchRegister_[GUID]()` as well as the auto-generated `catch_registerstaticlibrary.cpp` file.

Build it by calling `build.sh`
